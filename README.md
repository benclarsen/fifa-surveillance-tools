# fifa-surveillance-tools
A shared development workspace for standardized tools, code, and synthetic datasets supporting FIFA Player Health Surveillance research and reproducibility.

# Notes: 
The setup_functions.R script includes a function called setup_project_folders.R 
This creates a standard folder structure for administering a FIFA tournament surveillance project.
The folder structure in this repository follows the same naming convention, but unnecessary folders (e.g. 00_Admin) have been removed
